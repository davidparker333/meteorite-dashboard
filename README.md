# meteorite-dashboard

This meteorite dashboard visualizes data from the NASA meteorite dataset (https://data.nasa.gov/resource/y77d-th95.json)
and organizes it into a chart and searchable table. The table supports pagination, search, and favorites which
persist across session.

Running this project locally only requires installing dependencies and running with `yarn dev`. Have fun! :o)

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
